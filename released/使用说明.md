## 安装和运行 气球塔防6多功能脚本


### 要求

- win7,win10/11或者最新windows版本
- 

### Via GitHub with EXE [Recommended]

Go to [Microsoft PowerToys GitHub releases page][github-release-link], click on `Assets` at the bottom to show the files available in the release. Please use the appropriate the PowerToys installer that matches your machine's architecture. For most, it is `x64`.

- **For x64 processors (most common):** [PowerToysSetup-0.65.0-x64.exe](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases/download/v0.65.0/PowerToysSetup-0.65.0-x64.exe)
- **For ARM64 processors:** [PowerToysSetup-0.65.0-arm64.exe](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases/download/v0.65.0/PowerToysSetup-0.65.0-arm64.exe)

This is our preferred method.

### Via Microsoft Store

Install from the [Microsoft Store's PowerToys page][microsoft-store-link]. You must be using the [new Microsoft Store](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsExperience/2021/06/24/building-a-new-open-microsoft-store-on-windows-11/) which will be available for both Windows 11 and Windows 10.

### Via WinGet (Preview)

Download PowerToys from [WinGet][winget-link]. To install PowerToys, run the following command from the command line / PowerShell:

```powershell
winget install Microsoft.PowerToys -s winget
```

### Other install methods

There are [community driven install methods](./doc/unofficialInstallMethods.md) such as Chocolatey and Scoop. If these are your preferred install solutions, this will have the install instructions.
